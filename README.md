# Beecrowd Solutions in C++
🎯 About This Project:

This repository contains my personal solutions to various programming challenges from the Beecrowd platform, all implemented in C++.The main objective of this project is to document my progress, practice algorithms and data structures, and serve as a learning resource for other students and developers who are exploring the world of competitive programming.

📁 Repository Structure

The solutions are organized into directories based on their category (e.g., Beginner, Strings, etc.). Inside each directory, you will find the source files for the corresponding problems..

├── Beginner/

│   └── beecrowd1000.cpp

│   └── beecrowd1001.cpp

├── Strings/

│   └── beecrowd1234.cpp

...

└── README.md

🚀 How to Compile and Run a Solution

To create and run an executable from a source file, you will need a C++ compiler like g++.Navigate to the correct directory.

- Use the cd command to enter the folder containing the solution you want to run.

- Compile the code.Use the g++ command to compile the .cpp file. The -o flag lets you name the output executable.Run the executable.

- Execute the compiled program from your terminal.Example for problem 1000:

# 1. Navigate into the directory
cd Beginner/

# 2. Compile the source file and create an executable named "beecrowd1000"
g++ 'beecrowd1000.cpp' -o 'beecrowd1000.exe'

# 3. Run the program
./beecrowd1000.exe

💡 How to Use This Repository

You can browse the directories to find the solution for a specific problem. However, it is highly recommended that you try to solve each problem on your own first! This repository is intended as a tool for study and comparison. Please use it to: Learn about different approaches to solving a problem; Compare your code with another implementation; Better understand C++ syntax and standard libraries.
