Beecrowd Solutions in C++
🎯 About:
This repository contains my solutions to various programming challenges on the Beecrowd platform, all implemented in C++.

The main objective of this project is to document my progress, practice algorithms and data structures, and serve as a learning resource for other students and developers who are exploring the world of competitive programming.

📁 Repository Structure
The solutions are organized into separate directories, each named with the corresponding problem ID. Inside each directory, you will find the .cpp source file for that solution.

├── Beginner/
│   └── beecrowd1000.cpp


🚀 How to Compile and Run a Solution
To create an executable from a source file and run it, you will need a C++ compiler like g++ (if you're using vscode).

Navigate to the problem's directory.
Use the cd command to enter the folder of the problem you want to compile. Compile the code. Use the g++ command to compile the .cpp file. 
The -o flag lets you name the output executable. Run the executable. Execute the compiled program from your terminal.

Example for problem 1000:

# Navigate into the directory
cd Beginner

# Compile the source file and create an executable named "main"
g++ "beecrowd1000.cpp" -o "beecrowd1000.exe"

# Run the program
./beecrowd1000.exe

💡 How to Use This Repository
You can browse the directories to find the solution for a specific problem. Solve your own problem first! Use this repository to study different techniques to a problem, learn how to use the C++ language, but please don't cheat.
